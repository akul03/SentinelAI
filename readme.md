# Cyber Security LLM Agents

A collection of AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate common cybersecurity tasks.  
Built using [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).

Developed as part of our **RSAC 2024** talks:  
- [From Chatbot to Destroyer of Endpoints](https://www.rsaconference.com/USA/agenda/session/From%20Chatbot%20to%20Destroyer%20of%20Endpoints%20Can%20ChatGPT%20Automate%20EDR%20Bypasses)  
- [The Always-On Purple Team](https://www.rsaconference.com/USA/agenda/session/The%20Always-On%20Purple%20Team%20An%20Automated%20CICD%20for%20Detection%20Engineering)

## ⚙️ Setup

> ⚠️ Run this only in a test or isolated environment!

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Add your API keys**

   ```bash
   cp .env_template .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your OpenAI or LLM credentials.

3. **(Optional)** Start local HTTP/FTP servers for demo scenarios:

   ```bash
   python run_servers.py
   ```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Test your setup with:

```bash
python run_agents.py HELLO_AGENTS
```

If you see:

```
Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open.
```

you’re all set!

---

## 🧩 Build New Scenarios

Add or modify scenarios in `actions/agent_actions.py`, then run:

```bash
python run_agents.py <scenario-name>
```

---

## 🧪 Development

Run notebooks for demos:

```bash
./run_notebooks.sh <network-interface>
```

Check code quality:

```bash
flake8 --exclude=.venv --ignore=E501,W503 .
```

Would you like me to make this version more **visual** (with emojis, section dividers, and badges for “Python”, “License”, etc.) so it looks cleaner on GitHub?
